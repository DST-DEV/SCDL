Step 1: Install the QtDesigner via a virtual environment
For instructions see the "Qt Designer for PyQt6.htm" file
- Note: Instead of "python" it might be necessary to write "py -3.11" or whatever python version is installed

Step 2: Create a .ui File with the QtDesigner
For instructions see the "Qt Designer Usage Quick Guide.htm" file

Step 3: Convert the .ui File to a .py file
For instructions see the "Qt Designer for PyQt6.htm" file
- Note: instead of "pyuic6" the command might be "py -3.11 -m PyQt6.uic.pyuic"
- Note: Full Command is "py -3.11 -m PyQt6.uic.pyuic -x your_ui_file.ui -o output_py_file.py"
